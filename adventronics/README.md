Adventronics challenge
======================

Day 1
-----

Use the Barduino to blink an LED.

Blinking an LED is the Hello World of electronics, the first program you upload to check that everything is up and running. No better way to start the challenge than making sure everyting is ok! Easy one to start the challnge ðŸ˜‰

You can always got to Arduino/File/Examples/01.Basic/Blink, but if you feel a bit more adventurous here you can check a possible solution:


Day 4
-----

Communicate using morse code using the Barduino.

dot dot dash... Use your resources to encode a message, and try to decode the rest of messages!

Day 5
-----

Play a Christmas carol (or a song you like) using the Barduino.

Time to make some music! Use the buzzer (or any other thing!) to make some music, the idea is to play a Christmas carol. As we come from many different places, try to play one from your hometown, to have a nice collection of tunes ðŸ¥³



Day 7
-----

Make an instrument wit the Barduino.

2 days ago you played some preprogrammed tunes, but now it's time to read some inputs and make sounds acording to them! Be creative, you can play with the different inputs...

Here is my solution, playing notes with the touch pads reacting to light! I ave to practice a lot more...

Day 8
-----

Challenge!! Who will get the lowest temperature?

Use the temperature sensor to win, upload a picture of the temperature printed on Serial and a picture of the situation. It's not allowed to put the Barduino in the fridge... ðŸ˜œ Give it some time for the temperature to stabilize, it can take up to 15 minutes.

Tip, you can power the board with you phone and read the Serial there with an app in Android (I don't know if that's possible with iPhones).


Day 9
-----


LED's get artistic..! Today's callenge is to do light painting using the Barduino. You can use the Neopixel to get different colors!

To capture the image you can use this apps for Android and Iphone.



Day 11
------

Let's light up the Barduinos! Winter Holidays are always full of lights, why not we use the Barduino to create our own? Use the neopixel and your creativity to make a nice light animation to celebrate this days!



Day 12
------

Use the light sensor to detect when to light up your Barduino as a candle. There is nothing more "Chritsmasy" than the light of a candle, with family, friends or just te blanket on the sofa. Use the Barduino as a candle? Why not!

The idea is to make it automatic, so when it detects a low level of light it will light up simulating a candle, you will need to create a nice animation with the neopixel (don't try to light it up on fire...)


Day 13
------

Connect you Barduino with somthing else than the Serial Monitor. Today is about expanding the Barduino, using other tools to visualize what's happenning in your board. A nice option is p5js, but feel free to use any other tool!

Tip, the simplest way to do so is using Serial communication, but you can try other things like Bluetooth, MQTT or publishing a web page from the ESP32.


Day 15
------

Transform your Barduino in a Keyboard! The ESP32S3 has a USB-OTG mode, making it possible to be recognised as a keyboard by the computer. Use it to create your own keyboard.

Day 16
------

Let's play a game! Yesterday you transformed your Barduino in a keyboard, now let's use it to play a game. Program yoou board to be able to use the arrow keys with th touchsensors (or use the code below) and play a game like snake.io with it.

Day 17
------


Day 18
------

Connect to an API to get the weather, the temperatue or anythig else and visualize it using your Barduino.

You can try to use the SmartCitizen API



Day 21
------

Use the Barduino to ask ChatGPT to create a Christmas Card text with the ChatGPT API. With the ChatGPT Arduino library you caan send prompts directly through the Barduino.


Day 22
------

Now send the message from yesterday to te Telegram group using a bot! You can use te Bot we created if you want, the token is in the code as the groupID. Have fun!
